Social Media Ads Classification

Classifying social media ads means analyzing your social media ads for finding the most profitable customers for your product who are more likely to buy the product. Sometimes the product you are offering is not suitable for all people when it comes to age and income. For example, a person between the ages of 20 and 25 may like to spend more on smartphone covers than a person between the ages of 40 and 45.  Likewise, a high-income person can afford to spend more on luxury goods than a low-income person. So this is how a business can determine whether a person will buy their product or not by classifying their social media ads. In the section below, I will walk you through social media ads classification with Machine Learning using Python.
